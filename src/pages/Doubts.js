                    Yes, some blood donation centers are collecting plasma from
                    individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. Please check
                    with your local blood or plasma donation center to learn
                    about ways to help others. Individual centers will share
                    their needs for blood, plasma, or COVID-19 plasma donations.
                    If COVID-19 plasma is not being collected at that location,
                    please consider donating blood or plasma.

                    The fight is in you as a blood and plasma donor too! Current
                    inventories of COVID-19 plasma may be sufficient to meet
                    patientsâ€™ needs in your area. Although your COVID-19 plasma
                    may not be needed at a given time, your blood or plasma
                    donation is always needed to treat patients with other
                    medical conditions, including patients with severe burns and
                    other traumatic injuries. For many patients there are no
                    alternative treatments. A single blood donation will be made
                    into a unit of red blood cells and a unit of plasma that
                    means you will be helping at least two patients each time
                    you donate blood. Your plasma donation will be used to make
                    up to five live-saving medicines.

                    You should be symptom-free for at least 14 days before

                </summary>
                <div>
                  <p>
                    Donating plasma will not reduce your antibody level, nor
                    weaken your immune system. Donating plasma is sharing your
                    antibodies, not giving them away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Because antibody levels decrease naturally over time we
                    encourage you to donate as early as you are eligible to do
                    so, and as many times as allowed by your donor center.

                  <p>
                    Donating blood plasma is similar to giving blood. If you can
                    tolerate donating blood, or giving blood during medical
                    appointments, you should be comfortable donating blood
                    plasma. Highly trained staff will take great care to
                    minimize any possible discomfort.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In rare occasions, some donors might feel faint or weak.
                    Personnel at the donor center are trained to recognize and
                    deal with any adverse event that might occur. Eating a
                    healthy meal and drinking plenty of water before and after
                    your donation will help you feel well after your donation.
                    If you have a history of feeling faint at the sight of
                    blood, please let the donor center staff know.

                    Thousands of people safely donate plasma every day. The
                    collection process uses sterile tubing and supplies for each
                    donation. The tubing and supplies are discarded after each
                    collection and are never reused. Blood does not come in

                    Yes! Individuals who have fully recovered from COVID-19 and
                    are willing to donate their blood or plasma are encouraged
                    to donate on a regular basis. The blood supply is very
                    fragile because donations from a very small percentage of
                    our population provide all of the blood and plasma to meet
                    the needs of patients. There is an urgent need for plasma
                    right now due to continued impacts from COVID-19. Plasma
                    donors are needed now more than ever to make critical
                    medicines because patients depend on your generosity that
                    helps them lead a more normal life. Donor centers may have
                    additional guidelines so call ahead for more information.

                    It is recommended that you eat a light but healthy meal
                    three hours before your donation. This means a meal that is
                    high in protein (such as eggs, fish, or nuts), rich in iron
                    (such as tuna, lean red meat, nuts, or beans), and low in
                    fat (fatty or fried foods can interfere with laboratory
                    testing). Since blood plasma is 90% water, you should also
                    be well-hydrated, so drink plenty of water, juice, or other
                    fluids and reduce your caffeine intake the day before your
                    donation. Please do not drink any alcohol the night before
                    or the day of your donation.

                    Military ID, etc.). If you will be donating COVID-19 plasma,
                    a blood center may ask if you have had COVID-19 symptoms and
                    a positive diagnostic test for COVID-19, and that you have

                    While your donation cannot be used to treat someone
                    currently fighting COVID-19, please consider donating your
                    plasma or blood for patients who are fighting other
                    diseases. Blood and plasma are needed every day to treat
                    patients with other medical conditions, including patients
                    with severe burns and other traumatic injuries. There
                    continues to an urgent need for plasma that is used to make
                    critical medicines that help threat rare and chronic
                    conditions.

                    A person who is currently pregnant is not eligible to donate
                    for their safety.â€¯For six weeks after giving birth, a person
                    is not eligible to donate at blood donor centers where their
                    plasma will be used for transfusion. A person's blood will
                    be tested for HLA antibodies, commonly seen after
                    childbirth, which present no problems to the donor but pose
                    a risk to patients receiving plasma transfusions.
                    Additionally, for six months after giving birth, a person is
                    not eligible to donate at a plasma donor center. Since their
                    plasma is going to undergo additional manufacturing steps,
                    they will not be tested for HLA antibodies. If you have any
                    questions about eligibility, it is recommended that you call
                    your local donor center.
